# gitws

-> Start by creating a new branch with your name and module from main. Example: firstname-familyname-web

- commit and push a python file that prints your name
- cherry-pick the commit with the alpaca picture from the alpaca-pic branch to the top of your branch
- start a new branch called git-doc from your first commit, create and push a file on it that explains how to do merge in git
- commit and push a modification to the file with an explanation for rebasing
- take a screenshot of the current git tree visual and push it to the git-doc branch
- rebase the explanations on top of your original branch and squash the two explanation commits together

-> Create a pull request from your branch to main.
