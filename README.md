# gitws

1. Start by creating a new branch with your name and module from main. Example: firstname-familyname-web

    a. commit and push a python file that prints your name
    
    b. cherry-pick the commit with the alpaca picture from the alpaca-pic branch to the top of your branch
    
    c. start a new branch called git-doc from your first commit, create and push a file on it that explains how to do merge in git
    
    d. commit and push a modification to the file with an explanation for rebasing
    
    e. take a screenshot of the current git tree visual and push it to the git-doc branch
    
    f. rebase the explanations on top of your original branch and squash the two explanation commits together

2. Create a pull request from your branch to main.
